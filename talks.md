Here is a listing of conference talks I've given.

Interested in having me speak at your conference or meetup? [Get in touch](mailto:valerie.woolard@gmail.com).

Some additional topics that I'd be interested in speaking about that may not be addressed here: software and creativity, efficient database queries, engineering culture and leadership, silly slackbots.

##### Logging Off: Improving Low-Bandwidth and Offline Experiences on the Web

* _Given at:_ NationJS 2017, JSConf EU 2018
* _Abstract:_  when designing content for the web, we have to keep in mind people who are increasingly accessing the web on mobile devices or from places with less network infrastructure. This talk outlines how to design for low-connectivity users and why itâ€™s important.

##### Mixing with HOCs, Render Props, and Mixins: Managing Reusable Logic in React

* _Given at:_ NationJS React 2018
* _Abstract:_ React provides many possibilities for managing shared logic and concerns between components. This talk delves into the implementation, advantages, and drawbacks of three possible approaches to this common issue: mixins, higher-order components, and render props.

##### Code and Fear: Talent, Art, and Software Development

* _Given at:_ Bath Ruby 2018, RubyNation/CapitalGo 2018 (closing keynote)
* _Abstract:_ Writing code is a creative pursuit in many ways. The book _Art & Fear: Observations on the Perils (and Rewards) of Artmaking_ talks about the day-to-day work of making art, and this talk addresses how to apply its lessons to making software.

##### How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Unit Testing

* _Given at:_ RubyConf 2017
* _Abstract:_ Testing is important. But it's also hard to get right. Effective tests not only protect against defects in our code, but encourage us to write better quality code to begin with. This talk will provide ideas on the philosophies that should inform your tests, and a good idea of what makes a good test suite.

##### Good Fences Make Good Communities
* _Given at:_ Codeland 2017
* _Abstract:_ Web developers build online communities through their products, and they have a responsibility to protect those communities. Failures in security not only hurt your users, they erode trust in your product and the community around it. This talk walks through common security vulnerabilities and ways to protect against them.

##### Finding Translations: Localization & Internationalization
* _Given at:_ RailsConf 2016, RubyNation 2016, RubyConf AU 2017
* _Abstract:_ This talk discusses localization and internationalization for Rails applications. It goes over available tools as well as best practices for building apps for localization. I also talk about the more human and subjective struggles of translating ideas and concepts for new audiences.
